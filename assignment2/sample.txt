Malaysia has the highest number of coronavirus infections in south east Asia, reporting 4,346 cases with 70 deaths as of noon on Friday.

Reuters reported Muhyiddin as saying that Malaysia had done well to keep the infection rate at 7% of patients screened, which is below the 10% benchmark set by the World Health Organisation (WHO), while its 1.6% death rate is well below the 5.8% global average.

Separately, the health ministry said Malaysia had likely experienced its peak in cases. The country saw its highest daily jump on March 26 when 235 new infections were reported.
